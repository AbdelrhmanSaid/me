## How does Dependabot work?

Dependabot is a bot that automatically creates pull requests to update dependencies. It supports a wide range of package managers, including npm, composer, pip, and many more.

Dependabot checks for updates on a pre-defined schedule. You can choose between daily, weekly, or monthly updates. You can also set up a custom schedule.

For each dependency, Dependabot checks if there is a newer version available. If there is, it creates a pull request with the update. The pull request contains a changelog with the changes between the current and the new version. It also contains a list of commits that were made since the last update.

## How to set up Dependabot?

To set up Dependabot, create a file called `.github/dependabot.yml` in the root of your repository. The file should contain the following content:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

You can define multiple package ecosystems in the `updates` array. For example, if you want to update both npm and composer dependencies, you can add the following content to your `dependabot.yml` file:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
  - package-ecosystem: "composer"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

And that's it! Dependabot will now automatically create pull requests to update your dependencies.

## Conclusion

Dependabot is a great tool for automating dependency updates. It's easy to set up and works with a wide range of package managers. If you're using GitHub, I highly recommend using Dependabot to keep your dependencies up-to-date.
